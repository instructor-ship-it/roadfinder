## Usage Guide

### Work Zone Lookup
1. Select a **Region** (e.g., Wheatbelt, Metropolitan)
2. Select a **Road ID** from the dropdown
3. Enter **Start SLK** (and optionally End SLK)
4. Click **"Get Work Zone Info"**
5. View results including TC positions, speed zones, weather, and nearby amenities

### GPS Location Lookup
1. Expand **"📍 Find by GPS Location"**
2. Click **"Get My Location"** or enter coordinates manually
3. The app will auto-fill the road and SLK based on your location

### Offline SLK Tracking
1. Click the **⚙️ setup icon** in the header
2. Click **"Download Data"** to store road data locally
3. Click **"📍 Start SLK Tracking"** to begin real-time tracking
4. The app works offline after downloading data

### Admin Data Sync (v4.1+)
For updating data without developer assistance:

1. Click the **⚙️ setup icon** in the header
2. Expand **"🔧 Admin Data Sync"** section
3. View **MRWA Server Status** (record counts available)
4. View **Local Data Status** (what's synced and when)
5. Click **"🔄 Sync All from MRWA"** or individual dataset buttons
6. Data downloads in 5,000-record chunks to prevent crashes
7. Signage is automatically filtered to speed/railway signs only
8. **Speed zones are automatically corrected** for default zones (v4.2+)

**Speed Zone Correction** (v4.2+):
- MRWA default zones (e.g., "50km/h in built-up areas or 110km/h outside") are intelligently corrected
- Built-up areas: 50 km/h (detected by adjacent zones ≤80 km/h)
- Rural areas: 110 km/h (detected by adjacent zones ≥90 km/h)
- Validates max 30 km/h speed drops per transition (Australian standard)
- Original MRWA text preserved in `raw_text` field for verification

**Note**: MRWA sync requires internet. Static files provide offline baseline.

#### SLK Calibration
If the SLK reading is inaccurate:
1. While tracking, tap **"🎯 Calibrate SLK"**
2. Enter the known correct SLK at your location
3. The offset is saved per-road for future use

### Direction Color Codes
- 🟢 **Green** - Moving towards target SLK
- 🔴 **Red (blinking)** - Moving away from target SLK
- 🟡 **Yellow** - Stationary
