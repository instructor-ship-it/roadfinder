## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Starting a New Chat Session

**Each new chat session starts with a FRESH file system.** Previous work is NOT automatically available.

### At the start of EVERY new session, tell the AI:

```
This is the TC Work Zone Locator project. The code is on GitHub.

Run these commands to get the latest code:
cd /home/z/my-project
rm -rf * .* 2>/dev/null || true
git clone https://github.com/instructor-ship-it/roadfinder.git .
bun install

Then read PROJECT_CONTEXT.md and worklog.md to get up to speed.
```

### ✅ This workflow was tested and confirmed working on 2026-02-28

### Why this is needed:
| What Persists | What Doesn't |
|---------------|--------------|
| Code pushed to GitHub | Local file system changes |
| Git history | Uncommitted work |
| PROJECT_CONTEXT.md | Session memory |

**GitHub is the only true persistence.** Always push changes before ending a session.

## Overview

A mobile-first web application for Traffic Controllers (TC) in Western Australia to:
- Locate work zones by road ID and SLK (Straight Line Kilometre)
- Track real-time GPS position with EKF filtering
- Display speed limits with lookahead warnings
- Work offline with 69,000+ roads downloaded

## Target Users

Traffic Controllers working on WA roads who need to:
- Find work zone coordinates for setup
- Navigate to work zone start/end points
- Track their position in real-time while driving
- Know upcoming speed zone changes before passing signs
- Work in remote areas without internet

## Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components:** shadcn/ui
- **Offline Storage:** IndexedDB (client-side)
- **Maps:** Google Maps Links (no API key required)

## Key Features

### GPS Calibration Tool (v5.3.0)
- New `/calibrate` page for measuring GPS lag
- Capture target position (stationary)
- Capture pass position (moving)
- Calculate lag time automatically
- Export results to CSV
- Apply lag compensation to speed zone lookahead

### Speed Zone Lookahead
- Shows upcoming speed zone changes BEFORE reaching the sign
- **Yellow border**: Speed DECREASE ahead (warning shown)
- **White border**: Current speed (no warning for increases)
- Uses GPS lag compensation for accurate timing
- Configurable lookahead time (default 5 seconds)

### Work Zone Lookup (`/` route)
1. Select region → road → SLK range
2. Get work zone coordinates
3. See TC positions (±100m from work zone)
4. View signage corridor (±700m for signs, ±100m for intersections)
5. Weather, traffic volume, nearby amenities
6. Navigate to Google Maps / Street View

### SLK Tracking (`/drive` route)
1. GPS tracking with EKF filtering
2. Real-time SLK display
3. Current speed vs speed limit
4. Speed zone lookahead (amber border = upcoming decrease)
5. Direction indicator (towards/away from destination)
6. Distance remaining and ETA
7. SLK calibration for accuracy tuning

## Settings (⚙️)

### GPS Calibration
